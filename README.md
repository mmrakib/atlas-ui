This is *Mango UI*.

It's a personalised React components/template library.

I made it so I can reuse React components/templates I've made/liked across all of my projects. It saves me a bit of copy-pasting.

NOTE: I made this library primarily for my own personal use. Thus, it is highly opinionated, and all design choices are made to suit my workflow.
